# WorkingHoursManagement
Author: Marvin Baral (marvin.tgv@arcor.de)

Program to logg your working hours in a .csv - file. Written in AutoIt.
To start logging you have to execute "startWorking" and to stop it you have to execute "stopWorkingAndCalcTime".
It may be, that you have to compile the .au3 files yourself by downloading AutoIt and Choosing "Compile" in the Right-Click menue.
