# WorkingHoursManagement
Author: Marvin Baral (marvinbaral1997@gmail.com)

Program to logg your working hours in a .csv - file. Written in AutoIt.
To start logging you have to execute "startWorking" and to stop it you have to execute "stopWorkingAndCalcTime".
It may be, that you have to compile the .au3 files yourself if they don't work for you (they are compiled with Win XP). Do this by downloading AutoIt and Choosing "Compile" in the Right-Click menue.

The working hour entries are saved in data/saveWorkingHours.csv, which can be opened by excel or openoffce,... .

To add/ remove available topics, you have to edit data/topics.txt. Topics are separated by newlines.
